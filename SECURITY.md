Thanks for helping make our project safe for everyone.

## Security

Enedis takes the security of its software products and services seriously, including all of the open source code repositories managed through its [GitHub organization](https://github.com/Enedis-OSS). 
And we will ensure that your finding gets passed along to the appropriate maintainers for remediation.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Enedis-OSS repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please send an email to [dsi-oscoe-enedis@enedis.fr](mailto:dsi-oscoe-enedis@enedis.fr).

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:
